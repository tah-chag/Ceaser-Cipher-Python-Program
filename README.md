# Ceaser-Cipher-Python-Program
This project implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The program allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt messages using a customizable shift value, making it a great introduction to basic cryptography concepts
Features
Easy to use: Simply input your message and the desired shift value to encrypt or decrypt.
Case sensitivity: Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving non-alphabetic characters.
Customizable shift: Choose any shift value between 1 and 25 for varied encryption results.
Purpose
This project enhances understanding of encryption techniques, string manipulation, and user input handling in Python. It serves as a practical example of how foundational computer science concepts can be applied to real-world problems.

Getting Started
To run the program, clone the repository and execute the Python script in your preferred environment.
